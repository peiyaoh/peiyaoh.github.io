	abstract = {The popularization of Location Based Services (LBS) has created new challenges for interaction designers in validating the design of their applications. Existing tools designed to play back GPS location traces data streams have shown potential for testing LBS applications and for supporting rapid and reflective prototyping. However, selecting a useful set of location traces from among a large collection remains a difficult task. In this paper, we present TraceViz, the first system that is aimed specifically at supporting LBS designers in exploring, filtering, and selecting location traces. TraceViz employs dynamic queries and "brushing" to allow LBS designers to flexibly adjust their trajectory filter criteria to find location traces of interest. An evaluation performed with eight LBS designers and developers indicates that TraceViz is helpful for rapidly locating useful traces and also highlights areas for future improvement.},

	abstract = {Self-care in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is highly complex and individualized. Patients struggle to adapt to life with SCI, especially when they go home after rehabilitation. We conducted a field study to understand how self-care plans work for patients in their lived experience and what requirements there might be for an augmentative system. We found that patients develop their own self-care plans over time, and that routinization plays a key role in SCI self-care. Importantly, self-care activities exist in different states of routinization that have implications for the technological support that should be provided. Our findings suggest that self-care can be supported by different types of semi-automated tracking that account for the different routinization of activities, the collaborative nature of care, and the life-long, dynamic nature of this condition. The findings from our study also extend recent guidelines for semi-automated tracking in health.},

	abstract = {The Spinal Cord Injury Living and Learning System helps spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to acquire self-care skills through a clinician-managed virtual coaching program. It does this within a “smart” sensor-rich environment that helps monitor people with SCI and provides feedback to them, their caregivers, and clinicians. In this chapter, we discuss the basic design of the system, the requirements analysis and formative evaluation, and the technical lessons learned. We note the issues of sensor completeness and computational completeness in the technical design. We close with an analysis of what it means to design within a rapidly changing technical environment, one where the capabilities and constraints are unclear. The problem, as we discuss, is understanding how the social requirements and the unclear technical will join together over time, which we call the socio-technical trajectory problem in design.},
