	abstract = {Although lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose CT is recommended for high-risk individuals, screening adherence remains low. We conducted a randomized trial to compare two methods of providing LCS education to Maryland Tobacco Quitline (MTQ) callers in order to assess whether this setting may serve as a teachable moment for LCS-eligible individuals. MTQ callers (50–80 years, 20+ pack-years, prior LCS ≥12 months) completed the baseline and were randomized to the Print- or Web-based version of ShouldIScreen.com. Participants completed 1- and 4-month follow-up assessments to evaluate intervention engagement and LCS-related outcomes. Participants (Print = 152, Web = 146) were 61.7 (SD = 6.3) years old and reported 63.5 pack-years (SD = 36.0). Most identified as Black (54.2\%), female (66.1\%), having internet access (78.9\%), completing other recommended cancer screenings (86.3\%), and that they would undergo LCS if recommended by their provider (91.3\%). By 4 months, significantly more Print (75.0\%) than Web (61.6\%) participants had read the materials (P = .01). Most reported the interventions contained “the right amount” of information (92.6\%) and prepared them to talk with their doctor (57.2\%). Regarding screening-related outcomes, 42.8\% (Print) and 43.8\% (Web) had scheduled or completed a low-dose CT scan or a shared decision-making visit (P = .86). In a racially diverse sample of LCS-eligible quitline callers, offering LCS educational materials resulted in high intervention engagement and screening-related appointments. As \&gt;20\% did not have internet access, providing participants’ preferred modality (web/print) may improve intervention engagement and knowledge. Improving LCS awareness represents an important opportunity to increase screening among eligible but unscreened quitline callers.Although annual lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose CT is recommended for high-risk individuals, screening adherence remains low. In partnership with the Maryland Tobacco Quitline (MTQ), we compared Print (N = 152) versus Web (N = 146) methods for educating quitline callers about LCS. MTQ callers (50–80 years, 20+ pack-years) completed the baseline and the 1- and 4-month follow-up assessments to evaluate intervention engagement and LCS-related outcomes. Over half of participants identified as Black (54.4\%), female (66.2\%), and reported having internet access (78.9\%), completing other recommended cancer screenings (86\%), and would undergo LCS if recommended by their provider (91\%). Significantly more Print (75.0\%) than Web (61.9\%) participants read the materials. Half of participants reported the interventions prepared them to talk with their doctor (57.4\%). Regarding screening-related outcomes, 42.8\% (Print) and 43.8\% (Web) had scheduled or completed a CT scan or a shared decision-making visit. In a racially diverse sample of LCS-eligible quitline callers, offering LCS educational materials resulted in high intervention engagement and screening-related appointments. As \&gt;20\% did not have internet access, offering the preferred intervention modality may result in improved intervention engagement and knowledge. Effectively improving awareness represents an opportunity to increase screening among LCS-eligible quitline callers.},
