	abstract = {The Spinal Cord Injury Living and Learning System helps spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to acquire self-care skills through a clinician-managed virtual coaching program. It does this within a “smart” sensor-rich environment that helps monitor people with SCI and provides feedback to them, their caregivers, and clinicians. In this chapter, we discuss the basic design of the system, the requirements analysis and formative evaluation, and the technical lessons learned. We note the issues of sensor completeness and computational completeness in the technical design. We close with an analysis of what it means to design within a rapidly changing technical environment, one where the capabilities and constraints are unclear. The problem, as we discuss, is understanding how the social requirements and the unclear technical will join together over time, which we call the socio-technical trajectory problem in design.},
