	abstract = {Lung cancer screening, a relatively new procedure, is widely considered to be a promising way to address the low chances of survival from this disease by catching it at an earlier, more treatable stage. However, deciding whether to get this screening can be complicated for an individual; as such, patient decision aids are used to facilitate this process. To co-design a lung cancer decision aid, we conducted 5 participatory design workshops with 17 participants from African American and Latinx populations from communities with low resources. We also conducted 5 focus groups with 21 African-American participants to provide evaluative feedback. Through triangulating our fieldwork findings with other stakeholders, we detail the challenges of designing an inclusive decision aid and offer some suggestions with concrete examples, which complement current content-based guidelines, to assist in other patient decision aid development. We then discuss implications for applications to support decision-making in pervasive environments.},
