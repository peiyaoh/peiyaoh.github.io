To get a deeper understanding of the target population, children with autism, I collaborated with occupational therapists in a teaching hospital. In this hospital, the therapists conducted weekly sessions where parents of autistic children brought their children to attend sessions. I shadowed the sessions for two semesters, as part of the student group consists of students majoring in occupational therapy, and participated in the post-session debrief. The post-session debrief was designed to allow students to discuss their observations with occupational therapists leading the sessions and make a plan for future sessions.\n</p>\n<p>\nThrough observing these sessions, I identified several design requirements for a training application. First, the application needed to have a simple interaction flow that was easy to learn, as children with autism might have trouble concentrating on the training activity and could easily get distracted. Second, the design should employ activity that children were already familiar with as they needed to use such training application at home without the assistance and guidance of occupational therapists. Lastly, the terminology and concepts in the application needed to be simple as these children were young (e.g., around 5 years old) and did not yet have the capacity to understand advanced concepts.\n</p>\n<p>\nBased on these requirements, I designed a computer game that allowed users to perform the paper cutting and drawing activity typically used for training visual-motor integration ability. As I observed, children typically were instructed to follow these steps: first, use a scissor to cut the figure provided. Second, choose a scene as the background. Third, put the figure on the scene, add other accessories to decorate the figure and the scene. Lastly, color the figure and the accessories to make a picture.\n</p>\n<figure>\n  <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_900x250.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_900x250.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_900x250.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n    Illustration of paper cutting training activity: cutting the figure, placing it on a scene, and coloring the figure.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\nI implemented this flow in an application, CuttingGame, where children could select a list of figures and a list of scenes to compose their picture and colored them. I didn't use any words on the interface but instead relied on symbols (e.g., a scissor), to label each GUI widgets (e.g., button). All the figures and scenes were selected based on feedback from occupational therapists regarding how likely children knew these concepts.\n</p>\n<figure>\n      <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_screenshot.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_screenshot.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n      <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n        CuttingGame: children can select different figures to cut, color them, and add them to a chosen scene.\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <br />\n<p>\nTo evaluate the possibility of using CuttingGame to train visual-motor integration ability for children with autism, the occupational therapists and I worked with 7 children and their parents to field-test the game at home for a month. To evaluate the effect of CuttingGame, children underwent a standardized test that was used to evaluate visual-motor integration ability each week in the hospital before, during, and after the one-month training period.\n</p>\n<figure>\n        <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/study_flow.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/study_flow.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/study_flow.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n        <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n          Study process: participants took a pre-test to measure their visual-motor integration ability one week before given the game, played the game at home for four weeks, and took a post-test one week after stopping training with the game.\n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <br />\n<p>\nBased on the standardized test, I developed an auto-scoring algorithm that scored children's performance in CuttingGame by measuring how accurately they were able to follow the contour of the figure during cutting. To help occupational therapists to provide more detailed feedback, I also developed a playback tool so that occupational therapists could observe how each child was cutting the figures in CuttingGame.\n</p>\n<figure>\n        <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_part.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_part.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_part.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n        <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n          Errors are calculated as how far away from the contour, measured in four levels. \n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <br />\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"is-size-4  is-size-5-mobile\">Outcomes</h2>\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5  is-size-6-mobile\">Findings & Implications</h3>\n<p>\nMy preliminary analysis using children's gameplay logs showed that children achieved better accuracy after a month of training. Moreover, qualitative feedback suggested that children enjoyed playing the game at home frequently and thus potentially achieved the goal of extensive training beyond the hospital.\n</p>\n<figure>\n  <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/average_error_rate.webp\" />\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/average_error_rate.jpg\" />\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/average_error_rate.jpg\"  alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br />\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5\">Systems & Applications</h3>\n<p>\nMultiple applications were created as the outcomes of this project. First, a desktop application that allowed children to play the paper-cutting and drawing game, which recorded children's in-game performance (i.e., cutting path) for measuring progress. This was accompanied by a game manual created for parents to understand the game flow and different features in case they needed instructions at home. Second, a script was developed based on the evaluation strategies in Southern California Motor Accuracy Test-Revised (MAC-R) and the Visual Motor Test of Integration (VMI) to evaluate children's performance based on game logs. Lastly, a gameplay viewing application was created for occupational therapists to replay and review children's gameplay to provide further analysis.\n</p>\n<figure>\n        <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_whole.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_whole.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/evaluation_whole.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n        <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n          The error rate is calculated as the percentage of a cutting path (red line) deviates from the contour (black line) for each figure.\n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <br />\n<figure >\n        <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_player.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_player.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_player.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n        <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n          A player that allows occupational therapists to replay gameplay in different speeds to provide more detailed feedback for children. \n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <br />\n<div class=\"is-hidden\">\n<div class=\"columns\">\n    <div class=\"column\"></div>\n    <div class=\"column\">\n      <figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/ot_session.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n  An occupational therapy session - U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brien Aho [Public domain], <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Navy_100306-N-5319A-035_Ten-year-old_Joseph_Camano_performs_stretching_exercises_before_a_routine_physical_therapy_session_with_Occupational_Therapist_Judy_Anderson_at_the_Diane_Epplein_%5E_Assoc._Pediatric_Therapy_facility.jpg\">via Wikimedia Commons</a>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"is-size-4\">Background & Problems</div>\nOne well-established goal of public health officials has been the early detection of developmental delays. One aspect of the delays is visual-motor integration ability, which exhibits in certain children with autism. Clinicians often use standardized tests to assess visual-motor integration ability of children, with treatment activities such as having the children clipping and pasting paper for children to practice. These activities are designed and facilitated by therapists and require professionals to observe or videotape the sessions for further analysis. The time-consuming human resource requirement makes this more extensive training/evaluation (proven to be effective in the treatment of developmental delay) almost impossible.\n<hr />\n<div class=\"is-size-4\">Research Process</div>\n<figure class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"/images/project/cuttinggame/cuttinggame_900x250.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"is-size-4\">Findings and Outcome</div>\nWe designed a computer game, called CuttingGame, to approximate a standardized test in the assessment of the visual-motor integration abilities of children. By making the test a game, we created a playful experience that both assesses and trains children in visual-motor integration and does so in a natural and enjoyable way.\n<hr />\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing Enjoyable Training to Improve Visual-Motor Integration Ability for Preschool Children with Autism","date":"2014-09-01","keywords":["Human-Computer Interaction","HCI","user experience","UX","game","visual-motor integration","fine-motor","skill","children","autism","occupational therapy","training","field observation"],"project_tag":"cuttinggame"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/enjoyable-training-hand/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
