I worked with other team members to identify key themes using thematic analysis. One key finding was that they value the lived experience and believe they could learn from others, and yet, they didn't know how their own lived experience could be useful for others.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After noticing this interesting challenge, I started to investigate a way to uncover such implicit knowledge embedded in a person's everyday experience so that others can notice something valuable, and in return, allow the person to recognize the once hidden knowledge in her own experience.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">Conduct a Small Scale Study to Obtain Insights into the Potential of Sharing Journal Entries to Facilitate Knowledge Sharing</h3>\n<p>\n    Since the first step of such discovery requires the bits and pieces of the person's experience to be documented, the idea of journaling caught my attention as a potential starting point. I did a small experiment within our project team where members wrote brief journals and shared them with each other. The preliminary results demonstrated that we were able to document some experiences that ended up being useful for others, even if we wrote those journal entries mostly for ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Built on the initial positive results from the journaling experiment, I started designing a platform concept that would allow BIPOC entrepreneurs to effectively share such knowledge that reflects their lived experience and foster meaningful social connections, collaboration, and develop community knowledge by publishing on the platform.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">Develop an Online Knowledge Community to Test Ideas and Build Community</h3>\n<p>\n    I am currently leading the effort to develop a prototype to realize such a vision. In parallel, I am investigating the use of network analysis to understand and facilitate knowledge sharing and community formation. I also collaborate with team members to author a grant to obtain Google Cloud Platform credits in preparation for hosting the web app for public use. The short-term goal is to start alpha-testing with potential stakeholders.\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Public Interest Technology Knowledge Network","date":"2021-05-01","keywords":["Human-Computer Interaction","HCI","user experience","UX","lo-fi prototyping","high-fi prototyping","public","interest","technology","entrepreneur"],"project_tag":"pitkn"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/public-interest-technology-network/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
