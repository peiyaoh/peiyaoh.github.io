If objects are not placed at where they should be (e.g., socks in a drawer), the weather would turn bad, and animals would be crying and getting sick, as shown on the left. If everything is in place, the display will show a sunny day, and animals will come out and play (as shown on the right). The idea is to give children a display that could potentially persuade them to be tidy.\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"is-size-4  is-size-5-mobile\">Outcome</div>\n<p>The digital poster can be displayed on a standard computer monitor or through a projector.
