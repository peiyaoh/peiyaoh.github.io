I am particularly interested in how members of such care team collaborate and coordinate with each other with the goal of informing the design of sensor-based technology that can collect data to support such collaboration.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe overall approach for this project is to ground our design based on a solid understanding of care teams' experiences. I employed multiple methods to understand the care team members' perspectives and invited a patient to co-design with the research team.</p>\n<p>My team and I started by using semi-structured interviews and a focus group to obtain team members' experiences of managing or helping to manage the illness and care activity.\n</p>\n<div>\n    <picture>\n        <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_care_team.webp\"/>\n        <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_care_team.png\"/>\n        <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_care_team.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </picture>\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n        The care team of a patient: the patient, family caregivers, paid caregivers, and clinicians\n    </figcaption>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">Engage Stakeholders with the Concepts of Sensors and Data through Sketches to Facilitate Brainstorming</h3>\n<p>\nWith a solid understanding of the way care team members are collaborating and the challenges they faced currently, I then invoked sketches and other visual materials to introduce the concept of sensor and data. I employed visual materials as tools because our participants might not be familiar with the concept of sensors and data. Therefore, it might be hard for them to provide feedback simply through methods such as interviews that are heavily based on experience. The use of such visual materials helped our participants to reflect on how sensor technology could create a positive impact on their work and the unintended consequence that designers of such technology should be aware of.\n</p>\n<div class=\"columns\">\n    <div class=\"column\">\n        <div>\n                <picture>\n        <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_barchart.webp\"/>\n        <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_barchart.jpg\"/>\n        <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_barchart.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </picture>\n            <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\">\n        <div>\n            <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_progressbar.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_progressbar.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_progressbar.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n            <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\">\n        <div >\n            <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_five_star.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_five_star.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_five_star.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n            <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\">\n        <div>\n            <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_checkbox.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_checkbox.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_data_checkbox.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n            <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div  style=\"text-align: center\">\n    Four charts showing different visualization (left to right) highlighting 1) amount, 2) goal and progress, 3) ratings, and 4) a check mark (done it).

The two major themes were supporting routinization of care activity and allowing fine-grained control over data to share. For more details, please see the Outcomes section, including publications.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile\">Co-Design with a Young Adult as Design Partner to Identify Key Attributes and Develop a Web System</h3>\n<p>\nTo investigate how fine-grained control can be realistically implemented for regular users without technical training, I employed a co-design process with an undergrad student with a neurological condition for two semesters to design a mobile app for managing the sharing of sensor data. To truly engage the participant as a co-design partner, I designed a short version of the Human-Centered Design curriculum for the participant to get familiar with concepts such as persona and scenario. I invited the participant to be the designer who could bring in his own experience interacting with care team members to guide the design. Through weekly co-design sessions, I worked with the participant to design a mobile app that allowed a patient to control sensor data collected for and about the patient by regulating data sharing with care team members.\n</p>\n<div class=\"columns\">\n    <div class=\"column\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column is-half\">\n        <div>\n            <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_co-design_whiteboard_paid_primary.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_co-design_whiteboard_paid_primary.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_co-design_whiteboard_paid_primary.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n            <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n               A whiteboard snapshot of our co-design session where my co-design partner and I were discussing, for the same data category, he (partner) might want to have the capability to present data at different levels of details for paid caregivers and the primary caregiver.\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>As the participant was very passionate about video games, I also explored the possibility of incorporating certain game design elements (e.g., visual) to enrich the experience for patients to understand how to control the sharing of their data, in addition to the mobile app. I have implemented a system, Data Checkers, and conducted a comparison study to evaluate the effectiveness of the design to support data sharing in chronic care.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"is-size-4  is-size-5-mobile\">Outcomes</h2>\n<div class=\"content has-text-justified\">\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5  is-size-6-mobile\">Findings & Implications</h3>\n<h3 class=\"is-size-6  is-size-6-mobile\">Designing Technological Intervention and Support to Facilitate Routine Development</h3>\n<p>\nBy engaging with participants through various approaches, my team and I have identified two key aspects that designers should consider. First, care activities (e.g., drinking waters and doing bowel program) are being routinized continuously for patients and care team members to provide stability of care. Sensor-based technology should tailor user engagement with different levels of proactiveness based on the stage of routinization to provide the necessary support to care teams.\n</p>\n<div>\n    <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_tracking_routinization.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/png\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_tracking_routinization.png\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_tracking_routinization.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n        Sensor-based technology to support chronic care should tailor automatic and manual tracking based on difference phases of routinization of care activities to properly support the patient and the care team as a whole.\n    </figcaption>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3 class=\"is-size-6  is-size-6-mobile\">Support Fine-Grained Control over Data Sharing to Balance Sharing and Privacy (Sharing Just Enough)</h3>\n<p>\nSecond, patients desire to gain independence progressively within a complex and ever-changing care team. Patients want to control their lives but are not familiar with the nature of sensor data. Sensor-based technology should allow fine-grained control over data being shared to different care team members and provide support for patients to jump-start and understand the data sharing process. At the same time. as health, care team, and hence the care evolve, care team members will need a certain level of autonomy to access data so as to support their work effectively. Sensor-based technology should allow data sharing to be continuously negotiated among care team members.\n</p>\n<div>\n    <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_fine_negotiation.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/png\" srcset=\"/images/project/sci/sci_fine_negotiation.png\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/sci/sci_fine_negotiation.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center\">\n        Sensor-based technology to support chronic care should support continuous negotiation of fine-grained data sharing to appropriately support the development of independence within an ever-changing care team, whose members have different experience and expertise.\n    </figcaption>\n</div>\n<br />\n<h3 class=\"is-size-5  is-size-6-mobile\">Systems & Applications</h3>\n<p>\nAn interactive system, Data Checkers, using a board-game metaphor such as Checkers was developed to support fine-grained control.\nData Checkers' system consists of a front-end user interface and a backend server. The backend server was developed to support the interpretation and enforcement of sharing decisions. I conducted a within-subject study to compare our design with another state-of-the-art design proposed by fellow researchers. My evaluation demonstrated that Data Checkers allowed participants to effectively think and control data sharing of multiple sensor data sources with care team members and has the potential to support the long-term management of sensor data.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"is-hidden\">\n<p>A mobile prototype was develooped to demonstrate the idea of allowing patients to customize how to track different data using different input controls (e.g., a text field, a slider, or a button set).</p>\n<p>(showing the customization of mobile app? or the mobile app itself? )\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlemPpdFDhZRWyWINc17Byb-wjhPme9fkc4VPaXrTf4/edit#slide=id.g21befb6e70_0_70\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlemPpdFDhZRWyWINc17Byb-wjhPme9fkc4VPaXrTf4/edit#slide=id.g21befb6e70_0_70</a></p>\n<p>(a diagram that plot the system architecture? -> but I haven't published?

Making the transition from the hospital to home is a daunting process as various aspects of people's lives have to be conducted in drastically different ways due to the severe injuries, not to mention losing the constant support and guidances from trained health professionals at the hospital. Moreover, due to the loss of physical abilities and senses, there are extra procedures (e.g., monitoring hydration and doing pressure relief) needed to be incorporated into individuals' lives to maintain a healthy status.\n<div class=\"is-size-4\">Findings and Outcome</div>\nBased on the findings from interviews and focus group, my team and I argue that Internet of Things (IoT) offer great potentials to support the care team (e.g., individuals, personal assistants, caregivers, and clinicians) in this transition process as individuals naturally interact with everyday objects in various required activities. In this project, I seek to explore specific dimensions in the IoT design space, including user control, modality, and information sharing to design sensor-based mobile platforms and tools for supporting the care team in its on-going effort to create, revise, and recreate these routines that need to be integrated into daily lives to achieve desired outcomes (i.e., staying healthy).\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Support Informal Care Team Collaboration","date":"2017-08-21","keywords":["Human-Computer Interaction","Computer-Supported Cooperative Work","CSCW","HCI","user experience","UX","care","team","spinal cord injury","health","interview","co-design","patient","caregiver","clinician","awareness","collaboration"],"project_tag":"sci"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/care-team-collaboration/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
