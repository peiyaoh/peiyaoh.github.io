FIT shows curated categories of videos where people discuss their journey and approaches to diabetes. The goal is to help patients to understand how people with different viewpoints think about diabetes differently, the approaches they take, and how these approaches align with their viewpoints so that patients can understand how different information they receive from different sources (e.g., a clinician and an uncle with diabetes).\n            </figcaption>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"is-size-4 is-size-5-mobile\">Research & Design Strategy</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Managing health with chronic condition(s) presents challenges for individuals who have to manage various aspects of their lives according to the conditions and how their body reacts. This continuous process is likely to involve interaction with family members, neighbors, community health workers, and health professionals, who contribute their knowledge and viewpoints to help the individuals navigate through all the challenges. While having various sources of support from the social network seems beneficial, individuals with chronic conditions also have to make sense of the different and sometimes contradicting pieces of knowledge from people with different viewpoints.</p>\n<p>Based on previous work, we come to understand that these different viewpoints are the building blocks of how individuals learn to manage lives. With this understanding, we apply iterative design to explore how we could design a video-based mobile platform for people to easily present and understand various viewpoints for managing chronic conditions such as Diabetes.</p>\n<br />\n<div class=\"is-size-5 is-hidden\">Sketch</div>\n<br />\n<figure class=\" is-hidden\">\n  <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/fit/fit_paper_social_world.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/fit/fit_paper_social_world.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/fit/fit_paper_social_world.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>\n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n    A sketch shows an interface that features categories for different viewpoints and the in-between categories, categories that contains multiple viewpoints.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br />\n<div class=\"is-size-5\">Version 1: Multiple Viewpoints</div>\n<br />\n<figure>\n  <picture>\n                    <source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/project/fit/fit_web_overview.webp\"/>\n                    <source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/images/project/fit/fit_web_overview.jpg\"/>\n                    <img class=\"image\" src=\"/images/project/fit/fit_web_overview.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                </picture>  \n  \n  <figcaption class=\"has-text-centered\">\n    A high-fidelity prototype of FIT implements the initial design.
